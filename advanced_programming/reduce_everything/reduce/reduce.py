"""
Implement the following functions, at least enough to get the tests to pass.

Try implementing each from scratch, but also once you've implement reduce, try implementing
them in terms of reduce!

As stretch goals:

    - Add more tests, and have them pass
    - Increase the flexibility of each function, e.g. enable my_map to operate over any iterable type
    - Implement more functions in terms of what you already have, e.g. "flatten", "unique", "group_by" etc. See https://lodash.com/docs/ for a long list of interesting utility functions.
